We will pass notification to Our Administrator who will then administer claims settlement. Where such notification has been given We agree to treat any subsequent Legal Proceedings in respect of the circumstances notified as though the Legal Proceedings had been made or brought during the Period of Insurance. If You fail to notify Us of any actual or alleged act, omission or dispute during the Period of Insurance any claim arising from such actual or alleged act, omission or dispute will not be admitted.

If the claim is subsequently admitted Your costs in obtaining such an opinion and providing such advice will be covered under this Insurance. If during the course of Legal Proceedings You no longer satisfy requirements 2 A) and B) above We may discontinue cover in respect of this claim.
