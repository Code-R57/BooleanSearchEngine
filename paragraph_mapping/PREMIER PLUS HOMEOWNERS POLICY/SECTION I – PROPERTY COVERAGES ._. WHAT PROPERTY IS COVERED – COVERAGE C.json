{"2346": "Under COVERAGE C, we cover personal property owned or used by any insured while it is anywhere in the world. At your request, we also cover personal property: 1. owned by others, while the property is on the part of the residence premises occupied solely by persons defined as insureds; or 2. owned by a guest or a residence employee while the property is in any residence occupied by an insured. Our limit of liability for personal property usually located at an insured's residence, other than the residence premises, is 10% of the limit of liability for COVERAGE C. Personal property in a newly acquired principal residence is not subject to this limitation for the 30 days from the time you begin to move the property there. Our limit of liability for personal property owned or used by an insured and located in a self-storage facility is 10% of the limit of liability for COVERAGE C, or $1,000, whichever is greater. However, this limitation does not apply to personal property moved from the residence premises because the residence premises is: 1. being repaired, renovated or rebuilt; and 2. not fit to live in or store property in."}
