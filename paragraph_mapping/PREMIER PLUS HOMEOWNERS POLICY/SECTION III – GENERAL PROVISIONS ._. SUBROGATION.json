{"2466": "When we pay, any rights of recovery from someone else become ours up to the amount we have paid. Any insured must: 1. protect these rights; and 2. help us enforce them. If we recover damages through subrogation, we will pay you the amount recovered not to exceed the applicable deductible. We will be entitled to a recovery only after you have been fully compensated for the loss sustained. You may waive all rights of recovery against any person. This waiver must be executed in writing before a loss occurs. Subrogation does not apply to COVERAGE E, or to coverage under provision 3. DAMAGE OF PROPERTY OF OTHERS of ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS \u2013 SECTION II."}
