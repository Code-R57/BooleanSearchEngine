We will defend suit even if the allegations are groundless, false or fraudulent. Defense lawyers will be provided by us. We may pay the lawyer a flat fee to represent you. If any insured retains a lawyer for any claim, whether or not covered under this coverage, we will not pay the fees and costs charged by that lawyer. Our duty to defend ends when the amount we pay for damages resulting from one occurrence equals our limit of liability, including depositing funds into the court. We have no duty to defend any insured in any criminal action or proceeding in which the recovery of a fine, penalty or restitution is sought.", "2421": "We may settle any claim or suit as we think appropriate"}
