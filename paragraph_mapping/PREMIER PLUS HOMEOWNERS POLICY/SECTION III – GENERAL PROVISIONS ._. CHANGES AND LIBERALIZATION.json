{"2461": "This policy may not be changed unless we authorize and agree upon the change in writing. We will mail or deliver a written endorsement reflecting the change. Mailing or delivery by us to the named insured in the declarations at the last address on record shall constitute proof of endorsement or notice. If we make changes under this edition of the policy that broaden coverage without charge, this policy will automatically provide the broadened coverages as of the date we implement them, provided that date is during the policy period. This provision does not apply when we issue a new edition of the policy."}
