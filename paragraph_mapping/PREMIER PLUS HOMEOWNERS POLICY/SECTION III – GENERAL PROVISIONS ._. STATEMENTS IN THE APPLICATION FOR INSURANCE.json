We have issued the policy in reliance upon the truth of your statements. Any misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of facts and incorrect statements in your application may prevent recovery under the policy if they are: a. fraudulent; or b. material either to the acceptance of the risk, or to the hazard assumed by us, such that we would either not have issued the insurance or contract; would not have issued it at the same premium rate; would not have issued insurance in as large an amount; or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting in the loss, if the true facts had been made known to the insurer as required either by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise. 2. This policy contains all of the agreements between you and us. 3. You, or someone on your behalf, will notify us promptly of any change to the facts affecting this insurance, including but not limited to: a. any change of the location of, the title to, the use of, or the exposure to the residence premises; or b. any remodeling, addition, or new construction which will increase the cost to replace the buildings covered under COVERAGE A and COVERAGE B by $5,000 or more."}
