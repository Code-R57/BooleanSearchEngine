{"669": "Loss or damage under this policy shall be paid, as interest may appear, to you and the loss payee shown in the Declarations. This insurance with respect to the interest of the loss payee, shall not become invalid because of your fraudulent acts or omissions unless the loss results from your conver- sion, secretion or embezzlement of \"your covered auto\". However, we reserve the right to cancel the policy as permitted by policy terms and the cancel- lation shall terminate this agreement as to the loss payee's interest. We will mail the loss payee writ- ten notice at least 10 days before the effective date of cancellation. When we pay the loss payee we shall, to the extent of payment, be subrogated to the loss payee's rights of recovery. "}
