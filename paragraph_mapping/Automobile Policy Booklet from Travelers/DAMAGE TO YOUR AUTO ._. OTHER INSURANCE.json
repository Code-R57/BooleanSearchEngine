{"671": "If other insurance also covers the loss we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the propor- tion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits. However, any insurance we provide with respect to a \"non-owned auto\" or any vehicle used as a temporary substitute for a vehicle you own shall be excess over any other collectible insurance. "}
