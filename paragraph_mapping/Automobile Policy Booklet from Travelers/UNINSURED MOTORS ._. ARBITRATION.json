{"656": "A. If we and an \"Insured\" do not agree: 1. Whether that person is legally entitled to recover damages under this coverage; or 2. As to the amount of damages; either party may make a written demand for ar- bitration. In this event, each party will select an arbitrator. The two arbitrators will select a third. If they cannot agree within 30 days, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction.", "657": "B. Each party will: 1. Pay the expenses it incurs; and 2. Bear the expenses of the third arbitrator equally. ", "658": "C. Unless both parties agree otherwise, arbitra- tion will take place in the county in which the \"Insured\" lives. Local rules of law as to proce- dure and evidence will apply. A decision agreed to by two of the arbitrators will be bind- ing as to: 1. Whether the \"Insured\" is legally entitled to recover damages; and 2. The amount of damages. This applies only if the amount does not exceed the mini- mum limit for bodily injury liability specified by the financial responsibility law of the state in which \"your covered auto\" is principally garaged. If the amount exceeds that limit, either party may demand the right to a trial. This demand must be made within 60 days of the arbitrators' decision. "}
